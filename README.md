# Before read

- The number inside brakets, for example `(18)`, is the referring slide number
- The folders have the same name of slides pdf files
- If some slides has been jumped, it means that the content is not relevant for the course **(in my opinion)**
- The notes are based on 2025/2026 slides of Prof. Persia
