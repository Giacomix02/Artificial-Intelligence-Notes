An **AI system** is a system capable of mimicking **intelligent behavior** that is typical of **human beings**

### Capabilities of an AI system may include:
- learning
- reasoning
- perceiving
- acting
- experiencing sentience, emotions, or consciousness


## Definition
There are two type of definitions of AI depending of differents schools:

1. A system exhibiting intelligence as a property of `internal thought` processes and reasoning
    - Focus on the methods that are used to build an AI system 
    - **the “how”**
2. A system exhibiting intelligent behavior, as an `external characterization`.
    - Focus on the objective specification of what we want an AI system to do 
    - **the “what”**

`Intelligence` can be considered:

- **Fidelity** to **human performance**
- **Abstract definition**  called `rationality`: doing the right thing


There are two `dimensions` along which an AI system can be defined:
- `Humanity` vs `rationality`
- `Thounght` vs `behavior`

There are **4 possible combinations** of those factors:
- **Acting Humanly**: AI that `mimics human behavior` , such ad **Turing Test**
- **Thinking Humanly**: AI that `replicate human process`, focusing on **cognitive modelling**
- **Thinking Rationally**: AI that `takes rational decisions`, using *logic* and *reasoning*
- **Acting Rationally**: AI that `take actions` **to** `achive the best outcomes`
