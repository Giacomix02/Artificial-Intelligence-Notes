# Forms of AI: `Agent-centric AI`

**Modern technologies** and software applications have created a need for artificial entities that are more **autonomous, flexible, and adaptive**, and that operate as social entities by interacting with each other and with the humans or the environment
    - Such artificial entities are termed `“intelligent agents”` or simply “agents”

An **agent** is anything that can be viewed as `perceiving its environment` through sensors and `acting upon that environment through actuators`:
- human agent
- robotic agent
- software agent

## Environment

**An agent’s choice** of action at any given instant can **depend** on its built-in `knowledge` and on the entire `percept sequence observed` to date, but not on anything it hasn’t perceived.

## Agent-based AI tasks
- problems associated with a `sequence of decisions`
    - become important to use the concept of agent and a state of the system
    - `sequential` settings

>An intelligent agent plays the same role that a human plays in a  biological system, based on a sequence of choices that achieve a desired goal

## Non-agent-based AI tasks
