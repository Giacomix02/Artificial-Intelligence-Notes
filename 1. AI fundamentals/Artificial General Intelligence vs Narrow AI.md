# Forms of AI: `Artificial General Intelligence vs. Narrow AI`

Most **modern** forms of artificial intelligence are `application and domain-specific`, where the system is taught to perform a relatively `narrow task` (e.g., generate text or visual content, play chess, categorize an image, etc.).
- This type of AI is often referred to as `“Narrow AI”`

----

However, the **original goal** of artificial intelligence was to develop `general-purpose intelligence`.
- The subfield of AI that deals with the development of **general forms of intelligence** is referred to as `Artificial General Intelligence` (AGI)


## Strong AI vs. weak AI
`AGI` is also know as:
- strong AI
- full AI
- human-level AI

`Narrow AI` is referred as:
- weak AI
