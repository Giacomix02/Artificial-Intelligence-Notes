# AI goals and subfields

-  `Problem solving`:
    -  Enabling machines solving complex problems (e.g., games, puzzles)

- `Knowledge representation`:
    - Representing knowledge in ad-hoc formats that can allow machines exploit it for intelligent tasks

- (Automated) `Reasoning`:
    -  Generating intelligent outcomes and making inference from available knowledge

- (Automated) `Planning and scheduling`:`
    -  Generating sequences of actions or strategies to achieve specific goals

- `Machine learning`:
    - Learning from examples and generalizing to unseen data and situations

- `Machine perception`:
    - Ability to use input from sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, 
tactile sensors, and so on) to deduce aspects of the world

- `Intelligent agents`:
    - Dealing with entities (“agents”) that perceive and takes actions in the world

- `Robotics`:
    - Designing and building robots 

- `Natural language processing`:
    - “Processing” (i.e., understanding, analyzing, generating, and so on) data encoded in natural (human) 
language.

- `Computer vision`:
    - Acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images.

- `Social intelligence (e.g., affective computing)`:
    -  Recognizing, interpreting, processing, simulating human feeling, emotion, and mood

- `Cognitive intelligence/cognitive computing`:
    -  Simulating human thought processes by mimicking the way how human brains work. It involves machines 
that can learn, reason, and understand language in a way that is similar to how humans do

- `Generative AI`:
    -  Generating digital content of various 
types: text, images, videos, music, 
and so on.
