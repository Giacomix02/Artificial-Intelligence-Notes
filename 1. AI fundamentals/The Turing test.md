## The usage and invention
The Turing test was designed as a `thought experiment` that
would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question
**“Can a machine think?”**

## How to pass
To pass the test a computer wold need `at least` teh following capabilities>

- `natural language processing`: understand and generate human language
- `knowladge representation`: storing and utilizing knowledge about the world
- `automated reasoning`: drawing logical conclusions and solving problems
- `machine learning`: learning from examples



## Limitations
- `Not reproducible` or amenable to mathematical analysis
- It does `not rely` on a `rigorous definition` of intelligence
- AI researchers devoted little effort to make systems pass the Turing test
- It implicitly assume **analogy** between “behaving intelligently” and “behaving
humanly”, which somehow *implies* that **emulating humans is the right thing to do
to achieve AI**
